# Heavy duty mirror clips.

# This is for a 3x5' mirror mounted vertically on a rough cinder block surface.
# So, I used a total of six clips to support the weight, keep it in place, and
# stop it from vibrating when weights get dropped. Two on each the top and bottom
# (about 3" from the ends), and then one on each side (right in the middle). The
# clips include a slight standoff to make up for the the shit mortar job,
# which sticks out beyond the wall up to 1/4" in some places.

# Prior to a remodling, I had a similar mirror which was mounted on plywood (for
# the standoff) screwed into the block, then held in with the standard chintzy
# clear plastic clips. It would rattle all the time though, so I ended up shiming
# it with newspaper to remove the vibrations. Janky as fuck. That mirror broke
# when taking it out of the gym (Fuck! 7 years bad gains!), so as long as I was
# redoing it, I was going to redo it right.

# Nearly two years later, I'm getting around to publishing the files. And tbh,
# my gains have been pretty shit. Hah.

# My notes say I printed this with support, 50% infill, and a slightly thicker
# wall thickness (5 layers, because the plastic is cheap and the mirror wasn't,
# so better safe than sorry). Has held up great, and no vibrations whatsoever.
