# These are just little stand-alone standoffs that let you affix PCB's
# by their corners. The idea is to screw them into a scrap piece of
# plywood or 2x4 just for testing things.

# Later, I'll build on this to make a script for actual enclosures.

# Hole dimensions. Target using #8 screws because I got loads of them.

standoff:
    # Thickness of the board to be held.
    # Boards I checked all seemed to be about 1/16" thick.
    # Even if this is a bit too much or too little, it's not super critical.
