# This is the inlet to the Thien baffle.
# Be forewarned that even the base size pushes the bounds of my 3D printer.
inlet:
    thick: 0.4 in # thickness of the outside wall
    pilot: 0.11 in # clean up with a 7/64 bit and use #6 mounting screws

                     # You gotta kinda guesstimate based on the final height of the inlet
                     # and the thickness of your baffle sheet. But this isn't super critical
                     # because this setting only adjusts the outer radius to make it fit the
                     # bucket better,
