# Support for the baffle sheet.
# Probably want 3 or 4 of these. They won't be supporting too much load though.

                     # You gotta kinda guesstimate based on the final height of the inlet
                     # and the thickness of your baffle sheet. But this isn't super critical
                     # because this setting only adjusts the outer radius to make it fit the
                     # bucket better,
