# I did these prints on high speed with a Lulzbot Mini and eSun ABS+.
# For different printers or materials, you might need to increase or
# decrease the "fudge" factors slightly, to account for different levels
# of imprecision.

# The Thingiverse page has object files from these parameters, plus
# a XS, S, L, and XL degrees of slop (each tweaked in increments of
# 0.02") and small sample prints you can do to check which fits a
# given machine/filament combo best. There are also some photos of the
# hose itself, so you can sanity-check that you're printing for the right
# thing.

output:
    basename: vacbaffle-1.875/vacbaffle-1.875
    baseunit: mm  # Convert measurements to be more printer-friendly.

# Sketch out the dimensions of the bucket so we can cut the curve from
# our inlet adapter more easily.
bucket:
    height: 14.5 in
    topdia: 11.875 in # outside measurement, but roughly guesstimating to exclude the lip
    botdia: 10.25 in
    thick: 0.1 in

# This is the inlet to the Thien baffle.
# Be forewarned that even the base size pushes the bounds of my 3D printer.
inlet:
    thick: 0.4 in # thickness of the outside wall
    pilot: 0.11 in # clean up with a 7/64 bit and use #6 mounting screws
    pdepth: 0.35 in # depth of the pilot

    flange:
        offset: 0.5 in  # from the top of the bucket
                        # determines what diameters to cut in it

    fitting:
        # These measurements are from the tapered fitting at the vacuum end of
        # a hose.
        max: 2.280 in
        min: 2.245 in
        length: 0.75 in

        fudge: 0.04 in   # How much clearance do we add? This is really a function of
                        # how accurate your printer is, how fine your settings are,
                        # and what material you're printing with.

    clip:
        width: 0.85 in # to fit a 3/4" tab that's on top of the hose fitting
        depth: 1.25 in # how far in should the notch go
        leave: 0.10 in # how much meat to leave above the hose fitting
        catch: 0.1 in # how much of a lip to leave for hose clip to hook onto

outlet:
    thick: 0.125 in # general part thickness

    flange:
        dia:  4.0 in  # diameter of base
        boltcirc: 3.0 in  # diameter of bolt circle
        pilot: 0.250 in # drill clean to fit 1/4" bolt
                        # this will also make a backing washer you can print
                        # don't forget to caulk on the joint itself
    fitting:
        # These measurements come off the tapered fitting at the business
        # end of a hose.
        max: 1.78 in
        min: 1.73 in
        length: 1.5 in

        fudge: 0.03 in  # And again, how much clearance do we give it?

# Support for the baffle sheet.
# Probably want 3 or 4 of these. They won't be supporting too much load though.
support:
    height: 1.0 in
    width: 0.75 in
    depth: 0.5 in
    pilot: 0.11 in  # Again, drill out 7/64" and use #6 screws.

    offset: 3.5 in   # How far down from the top of the bucket you want the supports to be.
                     # You gotta kinda guesstimate based on the final height of the inlet
                     # and the thickness of your baffle sheet. But this isn't super critical
                     # because this setting only adjusts the outer radius to make it fit the
                     # bucket better,
