# Dimensions to fit a 2.5" Dustless brand shop vac hose.

# This one is slightly different from the Ridgid in both the dimensions, and in
# that it has the same size male fitting on both ends. The Ridgid one, in
# contrast, has male fittings on both ends, but the end where you attach your
# tool is smaller, and the end nearer to the vacuum is larger and has a clip
# (as well as an internal taper that could fit the tool end in it as well).

# As seen here:
# Thingiverse (TODO, but smaller holse is here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3277907)

# I did these prints on high speed with a Lulzbot Mini and eSun ABS+.
# For different printers or materials, you might need to increase or
# decrease the "fudge" factors slightly, to account for different levels
# of imprecision.

# The Thingiverse page has object files from these parameters, plus
# a XS, S, L, and XL degrees of slop (each tweaked in increments of
# 0.02") and small sample prints you can do to check which fits a
# given machine/filament combo best. There are also some photos of the
# hose itself, so you can sanity-check that you're printing for the right
# thing.
