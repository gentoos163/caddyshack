These are the basic components of a bicycle wheel truing stand.

The :doc:`dimensions.yml` file has a list of all the measurements,
comments describing how they effect the end product, and option
flags for a few things you can turn off/on.

The print files are available `here`__. And a video showing the
assembly and dicussing the options is `here`__.

Notes:

    * You will want to print the 40mm, 37mm, or 30mm spacers for when your
      mounting point is 3/4", 1", and 1.5" wide, respectively. (Yes, I'm mixing
      units, because materials in America usually come in inch denominations,
      whereas bike hubs are metric.) That'll get your front wheel (100mm hub)
      taken care of. For the rear wheel, either add 15mm spacers if you've got a
      130mm hub (road standard) or 17mm spacers if you have a 135mm hub
      (mountain standard).

    * Select the bracket that has the plug or not, depending on what your
      uprights are made of, as per the video.

    * If you are screwing into the bracket (either from the side or the top),
      use a #6 screw, or ream out the hole a bit and use a #8. Don't force a
      larger screw, or you will likely split the print.

    * Select the slider with a pilot hole for tapping, or with a slot for a nut
      if you don't have a 1/4-20 tap and don't want to buy one. When you do
      tap the part, be sure you back the tap out and blow out the chips a few
      times during the process, or it'll clog up, build pressure, and possibly
      snap the print.

    * The threaded rods should be 9-10" long for the pair of 3/8", and 4-5" long
      for the 1/4" rod. Any shorter will be cutting it close, any longer will get
      annoying. The uprights should be in the 16-18" range, and the mount should
      be however long your vise jaws are, plus a bit.

    * A 1/4 bolt knob can be put on the end of the indicator's threaded rod,
      and held in place with a nut inside it, and a jam nut on the bottom side.
      See boltknob.py for that bit.

    * I used ABS and high speed printing for the spacers, and standard speed
      for the other parts. Four shells throughout, since we need this to be
      pretty strong, and that provides some meat around the pilot holes for
      reaming/tapping.

    * You want to make sure you don't use support on the indicator nub, since
      that'll just make the pilot hole fill up. On the other parts, it's optional.
      There's nothing with an excessive overhang in this.
