; This is some stupid gcode for controlling the watch winder stepper via LinuxCNC.
; At some point, I'll probably redo this to be an Arduino sketch using one of those
; chintzy servos, but for the time being, I don't have any of them on hand, while I
; do have a LinuxCNC box and way overpowered stepper sitting right in front of me.

; And now my watch is charged for six months anyway... so consider this can kicked.

; The positions are picked as being about 2/3 of a rev if I home the axis with
; the winder horizontal. I just do 30k revs at a time because why not.
