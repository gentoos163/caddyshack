# Dimensions and such.

# I spec'd these out to fit my Giant Squid lav mic, and fit a
# steel collar stay for the magnetic back (superglued into place).
# Printed in fine mode on PLA. Really shouldn't matter too much.

output:
    basename: lavmic-clip
    baseunit: mm  # Convert measurements to be more printer-friendly.

base:
    # Dimensions for the base.
    # Thinner is better, holding the microphone closer to you, where
    # it's less inclined to wobble around.
    width: 0.4 in
    length: 2.0 in
    thick: 0.0625 in

    fillet: 0.1 in # Round the corners to make it look nice

lav:
    # These dimensions have more to do with where to place the mic
    # and how to hold it than the dimensions of the mic itself.
    # Here we define the block that will hold the mic.
    width: 0.4 in
    length: 0.5 in
    height: 0.45 in
    fillet: 0.0625 in
    position: 33 %  # From center, relative to the overall length of the base.

    # And this is the hole for it. So this actually depends on the mic.
    # It'll be given a slight taper for a better press fit.
    hole: 0.26 in
    taper: 3 %  # Make the diameter this much larger at the start.

wire:
    # Likewise, the block to hold the wire is really sized to taste.
    width: 0.2 in
    length: 0.5 in
    height: .4 in
    fillet: 0.0625 in
    position: 33 %  # From center, relative to the overall length of the base.

    slot:
        # But the width the slot (and to some extent, depth) determine how well
        # it'll grab the audio cable. So measure that out.
        width: 0.085 in
        depth: 0.3 in
