# Eventually this script should read a full-blown CSV table (eg. with pandas)
# instead of this silly file, so it could make *all* the knobs.

# The set of bolts to make knobs for. Kinda just assuming hex caps for now. TODO.
# dia and wrench are obvious. Cap refers to the cap height.
# Fudge is a multiplicative fudge factor, tweakable for better fitment.

# Some spec values for the knobs themselves.
# These are kinda bullshit numbers based on guess-n-check. I doubt they'd
# look nice universally for all bolts. But good enough for the ones above.
knob:
    points: 6  # Less pointed knobs, eg. 4 do fare better wih a lower roundoff.
               # Otherwise it's practically just a rounded over square.

    # Enforce a few limits, some absolute, some proportional.
    limits:
        support: 0.25 in  # Use *at most* this much support under the cap head.
        roundover: 0.125 in  # Use *at most* this much roundover on the top surface.
        height: 0.3125 in  # Use *at least* this much height.

    # Try to make the target sizing fairly proportion-based.
    size:
        width: 350 %  # of bolt wrench size
        height: 150 %  # of bolt cap height
        roundover: 25 %  # roundover on top surface, as % of knob height.
        roundoff: 99 %  # how rounded off to make the points. Note: 100% causes barfage.
        support: 33 %  # of cap height
